# Defect-Classification-AOI-Aidea
Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) [1] is a high-speed and high-precision optical image inspection system that uses machine vision as the standard inspection technology to improve the shortcomings of traditional manual inspection using optical instruments.\
\
In the training process I use the single CNN models using Efficient Net. I change the epochs and learning rate of the model manually, I don't use an automatic learning rate at the time. 

# Steps
Here we use the data from Industrial Technology Research Institute - Aidea to classify the defect. Unzip the file, it includes:

train_images.zip： 2528 images.\
test_images.zip：10142 images.\
train.csv：two columns, ID and Label respectively.\
test.csv：two columns, ID and Label respectively.\
ID is for the name of the png file. Label is for the class\（0: normal, 1: void, 2: horizontal defect, 3: vertical defect, 4: edge defect, 5: particle）\
Create a folder. Put the file inside the floder. And create\
\
Train_image\
Test_image\
Run the py file.

# Results
99.45745 % in accuracy
